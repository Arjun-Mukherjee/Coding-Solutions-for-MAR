Given two lists create a third list by picking an odd-index element from the first list and even index elements from the second.
Given:

listOne = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
listTwo = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]

Expected Output:

Element at odd-index positions from list one
[6, 12, 18]
Element at even-index positions from list two
[4, 12, 20, 28]
Printing Final third list
[6, 12, 18, 4, 12, 20, 28]


Solution-
Python code:- 

listOne = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
listTwo = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]
listThree = list()

oddElements = listOne[1::2]
print("Element at odd-index positions from list one")
print(oddElements)

EvenElement = listTwo[0::2]
print("Element at even-index positions from list two")
print(EvenElement)

print("Printing Final third list")
listThree.extend(oddElements)
listThree.extend(EvenElement)
print(listThree)
